Load up, select, aim, fire
Heavy artillery delivered through the wire
Roll up, tek weh ya empire
Heavy artillery, we bring the ball of fire
Load up, select, aim, fire
Heavy artillery delivered through the wire
This one heavy like ten tonnes
So when I drop it on the spot, you know I bring the vibe higher

Fully loaded, ready, never folding
Active when I'm on a mission
Tek the stats, leave you floating
It's vacant, then it's open
Shaky, then it's broken
Madness when I envision all this caddy that I'm smoking
Trample like an elephant
Sticking to the regiment
None of them do it better for the gyaldem looking elegant
Than me, or my day ones
On screen, with the bait ones
Bring the vibe higher when we drop it like ten tonnes

When we drop it like ten tonnes

Never see me, never see me, never see me, never see me
I double up, you'll never see me double back
I dropped it like a bomb, it had a heart attack
I do it for the Ps and the artefacts
I travel light, just a likkle duffle bag
Heavy artillery, a lot of that
Delivered through the wire, nothing stopping that
Entire empire, got a lock on that
Ten tonnes

When we drop it like ten tonnes

Load up, select, aim, fire
Heavy artillery delivered through the wire
Roll up, tek weh ya empire
Heavy artillery, we bring the ball of fire
Load up, select, aim, fire
Heavy artillery delivered through the wire
Give a fuck about a sanction
When I drop it on the spot, just get ready for the action
You know I bring the vibe higher

When we drop it like ten tonnes
When we drop it like ten tonnes
